With ~900 summer interns coming in weekly waves May - June, LLNL isn't in the best position to sponsor an official housing program. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can:

A) Get an apartment with roommates
  Close to the lab is best. Ironwood, Vineyard, La Vina, Livermore Gardens, Stoney Creek Apartments the absolute closest.
    - Amy '17: 7 of us lived in ironwoods and it was great. 3 or 4 people can share a 2 person unit no problem.
  Abol Verde, Briarwood, and Chardonnay Garden Apartments are farther but still closer than downtown.
  
  When first searching, call the place and ask about lease length because some places don't do 3 month (6 months is usually fine).
  If the place is unfurnished, you'll have to buy your own furniture. Getting stuff from Walmart is a good idea.
 
B) Rent a room in a house 
  Joanna, a (very dedicated) lab employee, finds hosts for about 200 interns every year.
  If you email her, she will give you a form with questions about your habits and then take a few weeks to find a host to talk with.
    ***Be persistent! Check up every week or so to make sure she didn't forget or something.
  Then, she'll set up an interview and if all goes well you get to cohabitate with a family and use their facilities.
  
  This is by far the most straightforward housing method, but there are often many rules to abide by.
  You might have a soft curfew, not be able to bring other interns inside, not be able to cook too much, and do chores.

There are a few things to keep in mind about getting an apartment, especially if you haven't had one before or are from out of state.

Unit Location
  If you are going to bike, perhaps ask for a 1st floor unit just in case.

Temperature
  Cheap apartments can have weird airflow issues that aren't immediately apparent, and California can be both too hot and too cold.
  Leaving doors and windows open can help regulate temperature when everyone's gone during the day, but don't let in bugs.
  AC units and fans may be loud at night.
    - Amy '17: First week was freezing at night. A month later there was a continuous week of 100 degree afternoons.
               A thin blanket and tower fans will make it easier to sleep. Also, I recommend earplugs.
Appliances
  Put in work orders for broken washing/drying machines, dishwashers, stove fans, fridges ASAP.
   - Amy '17: Clean out the lint from the dryer after every use. Just...do it. Or else the dryer does not dry. 
              Also, our washer + dryer were really loud. Just fyi.

Noise
  - Amy '17: Our upstairs neighbors had toddlers who liked to run, jump, fall over and scream a lot. Earplugs and patience recommended.
  
Bugs
  Spiders, cockroaches and small flies are common even if one doesn't leave food out or anything. 
  Probably not wise to leave out too much stuff on the floor.
