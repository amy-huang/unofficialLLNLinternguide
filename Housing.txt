With ~900 summer interns coming in waves every week throughout May and June, LLNL isn't in the best position to sponsor an official housing program. 
That leaves 3 options:

Get an apartment with roommates
  Close to the lab is best. Ironwood, Vineyard, La Vina, Livermore Gardens, Stoney Creek Apartments the absolute closest.
    - Amy '17: 7 of us lived in ironwoods and it was great. 3 or 4 people can share a 2 person unit no problem.
  Abol Verde, Briarwood, and Chardonnay Garden Apartments are farther but still closer than downtown.
  
  When first searching, call the place and ask about lease length because some places don't do 3 month (6 months is usually fine).
  If the place is unfurnished, you'll have to buy your own furniture. Getting stuff from Walmart is a good idea.
 
Rent a room in a house 
  Joanna, a (very dedicated) lab employee, finds hosts for about 200 interns every year.
  If you email her, she will give you a form with questions about your habits and then take a few weeks to find a host to talk with.
    ***Be persistent! Check up every week or so to make sure she didn't forget or something.
  Then, she'll set up an interview and if all goes well you get to cohabitate with a family and use their facilities.
  
  This is by far the most straightforward housing method, but there are often many rules to abide by.
  You might have a soft curfew, not be able to bring other interns inside, not be able to cook too much, and do chores.
